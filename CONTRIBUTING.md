# Contribution Guidelines

This is not a prefect TO DO TASK APP in Laravel if you searching for it :P

This is Repository is used as a Public repository where I want to explore the depth of Laravel to make a nice To Do Task App.

## 3rd person contributions
Any one who is interested to contribute is welcome but in the sense of some codes only and more or all codes suggestions and correction is most welcome.
I would recommend contributors to give me recommended programming techniques rather than writing my whole modules like a pro :) , LET ME STRUGGLE dude.
